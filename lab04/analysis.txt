NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the size of the tree.

==================
  BSTreeNumLeaves
==================

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: The reason why the function has the worst time complexity
               of O(n) is because the function does a recursive call and 
               in an event where there are trees with nodes containing one
               child it has to keep calling the function to check if all of
               the nodes is a leaf or not.
